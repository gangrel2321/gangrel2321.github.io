Hi I'm Jared Spang! 

I recently obtained my Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University where I researched Deep Learning methods for solving PDEs and curvature estimation in high dimensional data. Prior to this I worked at STR as a Machine Learning Researcher where I implemented, integrated, and improved upon new developments in the machine learning literature. This work largely consisted of general algorithm design, data science, and work with modern generative models (Diffusion Networks, GANs, etc). Prior to working at STR I graduated from Renesselaer Polytechnic Institute where I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics.    

I am particularly interested in mathematical modeling, data science, computer vision, and any other cool applications of math. In my free time I enjoy volleyball, rock climbing, cycling, listening to music, and generative art.
