My name is Jared Spang. I recently obtained my Master of Science in Applied Mathematics at Columbia University where I researched Deep Learning methods for solving PDEs and curvature estimation in high dimensional data. Prior to this I worked at STR as a Machine Learning Researcher where I implemented, integrated, and improved upon new developments in the machine learning literature. This work largely consisted of general algorithm design, data science / analysis, and work with modern generative models (Diffusion Networks, GANs, etc). Before working at STR I graduated Renesselaer Polytechnic Institute where I dual majored in Computer Science and Mathematics.    

I am particularly interested in mathematical modeling, data science, computer vision, and any other cool applications of math. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, cycling, listening
to music, and generative art.
