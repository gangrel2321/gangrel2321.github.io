My name is Jared Spang. I am currently an undergraduate at Rensselaer
Polytechnic Institute majoring in Mathematics and Computer Science. I am particularly
interested in mathematical modeling, data prediction/analysis, computer vision, and
any other cool applications of math. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, listening
to music, and have recently started investigating generative art.
